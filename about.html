    <p>
      TigerCycle is a resource for RIT dorm residents to see which washing machines and
      dryers are available in each laundry room. Users can also report issues with machines on the "Reviews" page.
      They can also issue maintenance requests to RIT through MyLife. On the "Useful Links" page, users can gain access to
      third-party and RIT resources.

  	<p>
      Comprised of four young college students, Wyatt Holcombe, Ben Stevenson, Gabe Knapp, and Jake Lombardo, 
      all produced this program. Ben originally came up with the idea to create TigerCycle and the boys all 
      unanimously agreed that we should make this program. It has been a semester long project and a long time coming
      and we are proud to be able to present it to you!
