    <p>
      TigerCycle is a resource for RIT dorm residents to see which washing machines and
      dryers are available in each laundry room. Users can also report issues with any
      machine to both RIT and our list of Unresolved Issues on the "Reviews" page. Users
      can use that page to see which machines are broken and haven't received maintenance
      yet.
